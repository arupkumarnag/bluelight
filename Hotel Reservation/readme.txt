Instructions: 

1. Run the index.html file and open the console with F12.

2. Open the app.js file put your values in the "room1" and "room2" arrays. 

3. Save the file and see the results in the Console. 


NOTE: I am not sure whether the approach is correct or even the solution is correct as I thought this solution requires comparing two arrays and returning the values. So being a domainatly JavaScript Developer I attemped the same and though of giving it a try as I have never applied these kinds of logic before. 
I belive this solution could have been achieved with Python a way too easily but I was not confortable with and was getting confused so I moved ahead with the JavaScript array solution method.
